You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

Solution

1. Create new node for each sum.
2. We need to save any carry (starts from 0)

3. Add two nodes + carry, save sum % 10 in first, sum/10 in carry. Once the carry is used, reset it.
4. If one of the nodes end fast, use 0, if both end and still carry exists create another node and add the carry.
