Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
UPDATE (2016/2/13):
The return format had been changed to zero-based indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.

Solution 1:
    - Loop through each digit : i
        - Loop through each digit greater than i : j, find nums[j] that sums upto 9
        - return nums[i] and nums[j]
        
Time: O(n^2), Space: O(1)
    
Solution 2:    
    - Put target - nums[0] to hashmap with index 0 as value
    - Loop through rest of nums, and if nums[i] exist in hashmap, return value of that map key and current index
    - Else put target - nums[i] : i to map.
        
Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
