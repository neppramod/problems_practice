Our first problem is to produce a list of the words contained in a document. (Feed such a program a few hundred books, and you have a fine start at a word list for a dictionary.) But what exactly is a word? We'll use the trivial definition of a sequence of characters surrounded by white space, but this means that web pages will contain many ``words'' like ``<html>'', ``<body>'' and ``&nbsp;''. Problem 1 asks how you might avoid such problems.
